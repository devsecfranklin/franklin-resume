# CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently.

[Continuous Delivery](https://www.continuousdelivery.com/) is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

## GitHub Workflows

I use [GitHub Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-and-managing-workflow-files-and-runs) to build my containerized application on every pull request. I also use workflows to validate
markdown files (like the one you are currently reading), run tox/pytest on Python code, and
more.

## GitHub Integrations

There are toms of great Integrations that can be plugged in to a repo to improve
code quality, test coverage, security, and more.

# Ansible

## AUTHENTICATION

* The kerberos tickets work but it is flaky. So we still use SSH too.
* Use Kerberos auth with my own user instead of "pi" user.

```bash
eval ssh-agent bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
kinit -f franklin # generate a forwardable ticket
make test
. _test/bin/activate
```

## Set up Ansible Server

The recommended approach to install molecule is using the ansible-dev-tools package.
Ansible Development Tools aims to streamline the setup and usage of several tools
needed in order to create Ansible content. It combines critical Ansible development
packages into a unified Python package.

```sh
# This also installs ansible-core if it is not already installed
pip3 install ansible-dev-tools
#python3 -m pip install molecule ansible-core
```

Molecule does not include ansible-lint (nor does the lint extra), but is easily installed separately:

```sh
python3 -m pip install molecule ansible-lint
#python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule
```

Molecule uses the \"delegated\" driver by default. Other drivers can be installed
separately from PyPI, most of them being included in molecule-plugins package. If you
would like to use podman as the molecule driver, the installation command would look like
this:

```sh
python3 -m pip install "molecule-plugins[podman]"
```

If you upgrade molecule from previous versions, make sure to remove previously installed
drivers like for instance molecule-podman or molecule-vagrant since those are now available
in the molecule-plugins package.

Installing molecule package also installed its main script molecule, usually in PATH. Users
should know that molecule can also be called as a python module, using python3 -m molecule ....
This alternative method has some benefits:

* allows to explicitly control which Python interpreter is used by molecule
* allows molecule installation at the user level without even needing to have the script in PATH.

```bash
make test
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH="${PWD}/roles" # from Ansible directory
ansible-galaxy install -r collections/requirements.yml --ignore-errors
sudo apt install -y sshpass
if [ ! -d "/etc/ansible" ]; then
  sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
fi
# ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg # generate a default config
sudo cp ansible.cfg hosts /etc/ansible
sudo ln -s $PWD/roles /etc/ansible/roles
sudo ln -s $PWD/group_vars /etc/ansible/group_vars
```

```fish
# for FISH shell, skip the "env" for BASH
env ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
env ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg ansible-galaxy collection install paloaltonetworks.panos
```

### Ansible Directory Structure

```sh
production                # inventory file for production servers
staging                   # inventory file for staging environment

group_vars/
   group1.yml             # here we assign variables to particular groups
   group2.yml
host_vars/
   hostname1.yml          # here we assign variables to particular systems
   hostname2.yml

library/                  # if any custom modules, put them here (optional)
module_utils/             # if any custom module_utils to support modules, put them here (optional)
filter_plugins/           # if any custom filter plugins, put them here (optional)

site.yml                  # master playbook
webservers.yml            # playbook for webserver tier
dbservers.yml             # playbook for dbserver tier

roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
            main.yml      #  <-- tasks file can include smaller files if warranted
        handlers/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- handlers file
        templates/        #  <-- files for use with the template resource
            ntp.conf.j2   #  <------- templates end in .j2
        files/            #
            bar.txt       #  <-- files for use with the copy resource
            foo.sh        #  <-- script files for use with the script resource
        vars/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- variables associated with this role
        defaults/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- default lower priority variables for this role
        meta/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- role dependencies
        library/          # roles can also include custom modules
        module_utils/     # roles can also include custom module_utils
        lookup_plugins/   # or other types of plugins, like lookup in this case

    webtier/              # same kind of structure as "common" was above, done for the webtier role
    monitoring/           # ""
    fooapp/               # ""
```

## Collections

One of the recommended ways to create a collection is to place it under a
collections/ansible_collections directory. If you don't put your collection into
a directory named ansible_collections, molecule won't be able to find your role.

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection init lab.franklin # create the new collection if needed
ANSIBLE_HOME=${PWD} sudo ansible-galaxy collection init lab.franklin -vvv
```

### Collection: Palo Alto Firewall

[Examples](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/ansible-pan/tree/master/examples)

```sh
ansible-playbook -i firewalls playbook/firewalls.yml --ask-vault-pass -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
```

## Operation

```sh
ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts -b --list-hosts nodes
ansible nodes -m ping -b -i /etc/ansible/hosts
ansible all -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution*" -i /home/franklin/workspace/LAB/lab-home/ansible/hosts # check dists
```

## Example Commands

```sh
ansible raspi_nodes -a 'apt update' -b -i ./hosts
ansible raspi_nodes -a 'apt -y upgrade' -b -i ./hosts
ansible nvidia_nodes -a 'apt update' -b -i /etc/ansible/hosts -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
ansible-playbook ansible/collections/ansible_collections/lab/franklin/playbooks/playbook.yml -i ./hosts -b
```

## Managing Roles

Create a new Role:

```sh
molecule init role acme.my_new_role --driver-name docker
```

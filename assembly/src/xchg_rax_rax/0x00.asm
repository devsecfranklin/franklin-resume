; Zero all the things! Or at least some of the things.

xor      eax,eax  ; zero the eax register
lea      rbx,[0]  ; set rbx to memory address zero
loop     $        ; resets counter register rcx by looping to the current instruction until it's zero?
mov      rdx,0    ; set rdx to zero (I see a theme here)
and      esi,0    ; aaand another way to set to zero
sub      edi,edi  ; you guessed it
push     0        ; push zero to the stack...
pop      rbp      ; and pop it back off again into the stack base pointer

            In the mid 90's I worked as a contractor doing analog to digital cellular system overlays. My Linux skills

            the same folks, they brought me into Motorola as a Field Engineer. Eventually I moved to a team doing switch
            upgrades with custom Linux laptops across the US and Japan. I also worked in System Integration and Test

<P>Born in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1905, Karl Jansky attended the University of 
Wisconsin. After graduation in 1928, he joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories 
in New Jersey. His work there dealt with the problems of the shortwave radio 
telephone. In 1931 he was assigned the task of tracking down the crackling 
static noises that plagued overseas telephone reception. At the Holmdel station 
he constructed a large directional antenna system. 
<P>Jansky recorded two well-known kinds of atmospheric static: crashes from 
local thunderstorms and noise from distant thunderstorms reflected from the 
ionosphere. From his records he later singled out a weak third kind of static 
that could hardly be distinguished from the internal receiver noise. Through 
headphones the weak noise sounded like a steady hissing. At first Jansky thought 
that the interference came from the Sun, but after a year of careful measurement 
he concluded that the radio waves came from a specific region on the sky every 
23 hours and 56 minutes. Suspecting that the radiation was coming from an 
astronomical source, he attempted to trace its origin. He knew from his study of 
astronomy that the period of the Earth's rotation relative to the stars was 4 
minutes less than its 24-hour period relative to the Sun, and this was the clue 
that the radio noise originated in space beyond the Solar System. He found that 
its direction coincided with the constellation Sagittarius toward the center of 
the Milky Way. In the publication of his work he made two very perceptive 
comments: He suggested that the radio emission was somehow connected to the 
Milky Way and that it originated not from stars but from ionized interstellar 
gas. (This is not the same thing as 21-cm radiation from atomic hydrogen.) 
<P>At the age of 26, Jansky had made a historic discovery--that celestial bodies 
could emit radio waves as well as light waves. But his results, published first 
in 1932, received little attention. Not until the end of World War II was the 
significance of his achievement widely appreciated. 
<P>Jansky's serendipitous discovery gave birth to a new branch of astronomy, 
radio astronomy. In Jansky's honor, astronomers named the unit of radio flux the 
jansky (= 10-26 W/m2.Hz).

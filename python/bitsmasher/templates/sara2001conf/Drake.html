<blockquote>
<p>Frank Drake was born in Chicago on May 28, 1930 to Richard and Winifred
Drake. Raised in Chicago's South Shore with sister, Alma, and brother,
Robert, he had a fairly typical childhood.</p>

<p>Always interested in science, he and his friends would spend hours experimenting
with motors, radios, and chemistry sets. As his understanding of astronomy
and the actual size of the universe grew he began to wonder about the possibility
of the existence of other planets and life on those planets. The idea seemed
reasonable to him. However, because of the religious convictions of his
parents and teachers he never felt comfortable bringing up the subject of
extraterrestrial life. </p>

<p>After high school Drake enrolled at Cornell on an ROTC scholarship to
study electronics. It was here that he fell in love with astronomy and
finally found someone else who was considering the possibilities of life
on other planets.</p>

<p>In 1951, during his junior year he attended a lecture by Otto Struve,
one of the world's preeminent astrophysicists. Towards the end of a lecture
Struve showed that there was mounting evidence that planetary systems had
most likely formed around half of the stars in the galaxy. Struve went
on to state that life could certainly exist on some of those planets. Finally,
Drake had found someone who shared his ideas.</p>

<p>After college he spent the next three years with the Navy to repay
his scholarship. Thanks to his electronics degree he ended up as the electronics
officer on the USS Albany where he gained invaluable experience operating
and fixing the latest high tech electronic equipment.</p>

<p>When his Navy tour ended, Drake headed to Harvard graduate school to
study optical astronomy. Fortunately, the only summer position available
was in radio astronomy. Because of his electronics experience in the
Navy he was a natural fit because the radio astronomy equipment was constantly
in need of tweaking and repair. Drake got hooked on radio astronomy and
never looked back.</p>

<p>Upon finishing graduate school in 1958 he got a position at the newly
founded National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West
Virginia. It was here in 1960 that the first search took place. Named Project
Ozma by Drake, the search was a two week observation of the stars Tau Ceti
and Epsilon Eridani. At one point during the search a false alarm, which
turned out to be a terrestrial signal, caused some excitement. Other
than that no signals were detected. Hardly expecting to find evidence of
advanced civilizations on the first try the searchers were not disappointed
by the result, but were encouraged because the search had finally begun.</p>

<p>In 1961 Drake and J. Peter Pearman, an officer on the Space Science
Board of the National Academy of Sciences, organized the first SETI conference.
The three day meeting, held at the NRAO, was a small gathering of a dozen
or so scientists who had shown an interest in SETI. It was in preparation
for this conference that Drake came up with the now famous <a href="drake_equation.html">Drake
Equation</a>:</p>

<h1 align=center>N = N<font SIZE=+1>*</font> f<font SIZE=+1>p</font> n<font SIZE=+1>e</font>
f<font SIZE=+1>l</font> f<font SIZE=+1>i</font> f<font SIZE=+1>c</font>
f<font SIZE=+0>L</font></h1>

<p>The purpose of the equation was to help focus the conference attendees'
attention on the crucial questions that needed to be answered in order
to determine the chances of SETI's success.</p>

<p>In 1963 Drake took a short-lived position at the Jet Propulsion Lab
and later that year he took a position at Cornell's Center for Radiophysics
and Space Research. Two years later he accepted the directorship of the
Cornell run Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>Drake and his family returned to Cornell in 1968.</p>

02_06 - Scheduling

Use label selectors to schedule Pods. 

label selectors can be used to tell the scheduler where to run pods. There are a number of buil-in node labels such as those for failure domains, zones, and regions. you can see these with

kubectl get nodes --show-labels=true

You can also use label selectors to do things like node affinity and anti-affinity. 

A common way to use label selectors to tell the scheduler where to run pods is to use the nodeselector labsl. Generally you don't need this but in special circumstances you might want to, for example, only have an critical application run on nodes that have, high performance SSD disk, just as an example. 

To do this, you use the nodeSelector 
nodeSelector tells kubernetes to deploy a pod only to nodes containing a particular label

    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:1.16-alpine-perl
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
      nodeSelector:
       disktype: "ssd"

kubectl label node k8s-2 disktype=ssd
k get node --show-labels=true

k create -f webapp1.yml

kp -o=wide

IMHO one of the hardest things to figure out how to do is to remove a label. Here's how-
kubectl label node k8s-2 disktype-

Understand the role of DaemonSets.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/
simply to run a single pod on each node in the cluster - this is ideal for things like logging , cluster storange daemons, or node monitoring like prometheus
k create -f daemonset.yml

Understand how resource limits can affect Pod scheduling.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/

spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-resource-test
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
      	cpu: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "0.5Gi"

k describe node k8s-2

Understand how to run multiple schedulers and how to configure Pods to use them.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/

Manually schedule a pod without a scheduler.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/static-pod/

Display scheduler events.
kubectl describe
kubectl get events
kubectl get events - w
cat /var/log/kube-scheduler.log

/var/log/container/kube*

sudo cat kube-scheduler...

Know how to configure the Kubernetes scheduler.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/scheduling/policies/

ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler

sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf

usually related to taints, tolerations, affinity, and anti-affinity

cat daemonset.yml
to tolerate the taint of the master node role
